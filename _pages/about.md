I'm a third year graduate student from [CVNext@ZJU](https://cvnext.github.io), supervised by Prof.[Gaoang Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoangwang/) since 2022. My research interest includes Multimodal Learning and Transfer Learning. Before that, I recieved my Bachelor degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications([BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn)), from 2018 to 2022. I expect to obtain my master's degree from Zhejiang University([ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn)) in 2025. I will enroll at Hong Kong Baptist University ([HKBU](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/)) in 2025 to pursue a Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof.[Jing Ma](https://majingcuhk.github.io/).
